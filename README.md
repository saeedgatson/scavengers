# Scavenger

Scavenger is a 2D Roguelike game created using the [Unity Game Engine][1] and [C#][2].

It was built while following a intermediate level Unity tutorial called [Project: 2D Roguelike][3]

Over the course of the video series you create procedural tile based levels, implement turn based movement, add a hunger system, audio and mobile touch controls.

## Additions I've added:
I've made a few additions to the project that where not part of the original tutorial.

- **Setup Project To Work With Unity Remote** - [Unity Remote 4][4] allows you to easily test the game on a mobile device.

- **Change Project To Build To Android vs iOS** - This was a purely decision based on available hardware.

- **Support Keyboard And Mobile Input Together When** - When testing from the editor you'll now be able send command via the keyboard or mobile device. This makes testing more flexible.
